Automated Photo Captioning Project

*Overview*
This project implements an automated photo captioning system using deep learning techniques. It combines computer vision and natural language processing to generate meaningful captions for images.

Features
Image Feature Extraction: Leverages pre-trained models like InceptionV3 or ResNet for feature extraction.
Caption Generation: Utilizes LSTM-based sequence models for generating image descriptions.
Training Dataset: Includes steps for preprocessing and working with datasets such as MS COCO or Flickr8k.

Dependencies
List of Python libraries required for this project:

TensorFlow/Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib
NLTK or SpaCy (for text preprocessing)
PIL (for image handling)
Methodology
Data Preprocessing:
Tokenization and padding of captions.
Feature extraction from images.

Model Architecture:
Encoder-Decoder framework.
Use of CNN features as inputs to an LSTM-based RNN.
Training and Evaluation:
Categorical cross-entropy loss.
BLEU scores for evaluation.

Results
BLEU scores and example captions for various test images.
Visualization of the generated captions alongside input images.

How to Run: 
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the notebook in Jupyter:
jupyter notebook Automated_Photo_Captioning_Project.ipynb
Ensure the dataset is downloaded and placed in the correct directory.
